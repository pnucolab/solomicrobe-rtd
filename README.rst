SHARP-FISH
=========================

This repository provides comprehensive documentation for the SoloMicrobe tool. 
It includes a detailed user guide for the web interface, instructions for using the command-line interface (CLI), 
and a Docker Compose file for easy local deployment.

Prerequisites
=============

To run the command-line interface or host the web application locally, an OpenCL-compatible device is required. 
OpenCL (Open Computing Language) enables parallel computing across heterogeneous systems and is essential for the
high-performance computational tasks performed by Cas-OFFinder.

System Requirements:
--------------------
• OS: Linux (recommended); should work on macOS with minor changes.
• Disk / RAM: Enough space for reference genomes and alignment outputs
• Conda / mamba: to create the probeset environment from conda_environment.yml.
• Python: 3.11 (environment uses Python 3.11).
• Node.js / npm: Node >=16 and npm for the frontend
• Redis: a Redis server available for Celery broker/back-end (default redis://localhost:6379/1).
• Docker: docker / docker-compose if you prefer containerized deployment.
• Python pip deps: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Celery, Redis client, Biopython, pandas, numpy, requests, lxml, pydantic, etc. See requirements.txt.
• Alignment & utilities: samtools, gffread, RazerS3 — required for probe alignment and processing
